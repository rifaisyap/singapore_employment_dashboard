Residents comprise Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Based on mid-year Labour Force Survey except for Census of Population 2000 and General Household Survey 2005.  Data from year 2020 are classified based on Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) 2020.  Data before year 2020 which were coded based on earlier versions of the SSOC were mapped to SSOC 2020 as far as possible to facilitate data comparability.  Data are not available for 2006 as the level of occupational detail collected in 2006 did not support mapping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occupation:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Occupation of a working person refers to the kind of work the person was doing during the reference period, which may not necessarily be related to his training, skill or professional qualification. In the case of a person who performs two or more kinds of work, his occupation would refer to the one in which he usually works the longest hours during the reference period. The Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) is used to classify working persons by occupation. SSOC 2015 is used to classify the data from 2015 onwards. SS0C 2010 is used to classify working persons for the years 2010 and 2012/13. SSOC 2005 and SSOC 2000 are used to classify the data for the years 2005 and 2000 respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
